Welcome to `ruby-on-chess`.

This app seeks to allow command line instructions to play chess. The aim of this
app is to be useful for players want to play eventually blindfold chess or chess
without a board.

Here are some aspects of command line functionality, that would be good to
feature in the game.

Move(first location, finish location) - moves pieces to finish location
Places() - lists where all pieces are located.
Place(location) - reveal what piece is on that square of if the square is empty.
The game only allows legal moves.
The game allows the input white and black with a turn based system.
